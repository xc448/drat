#' Impute missing ages in pedigree
#'
#' Imputes missing current, cancer affection, and death ages for relatives in 
#' `ped`, subject to age-bounding information. 
#'
#' @details 
#' First, we impute the missing censoring ages (stored as `ped$CurAge`) of 
#' living first-degree relatives, followed by second-degree relatives and then 
#' more distant relatives. If more than one proband is supplied, the first one 
#' will be used to determine first- and second-degree relatives. 
#' 
#' Within each group of relatives, we estimate current age bounds for each 
#' individual (see \code{\link{.getAgeFromPed}} documentation). The relative 
#' with the narrowest age bound interval in the relative group has their 
#' current age imputed first, from a normal distribution truncated by their age 
#' bounds (see \code{\link{.currentAgeImpute}}  documentation). The pedigree is 
#' updated with this relative's imputed age and the age bounds are then 
#' re-calculated for the remaining relatives in the relative group. This 
#' process repeats until no living individuals with missing censoring ages are 
#' left in the relative group.
#'
#' After all missing censoring ages for living relatives have been imputed, we 
#' impute missing cancer affection ages. For each missing age, the upper bound 
#' is the minimum of the individual's censoring age, their upper bound for this 
#' cancer's affection age, and `PanelPRO:::MAXAGE`; the lower bound is the 
#' maximum of their lower bound for this cancer's affection age, their ages of 
#' preventative interventions (if relevant), and `1`. The affection age is 
#' then sampled based on the crude SEER cancer penetrance estimates (subset by 
#' the individual's race and sex) within the age bounds (see 
#' \code{\link{.cancerAgeImpute}} documentation). If a missing cancer age 
#' cannot be sampled such that it satisfies its age bounds, this imputation run 
#' will be discarded and re-attempted, with a warning message issued. If the 
#' desired number of runs (`iterations`, default `20`) cannot be imputed within 
#' `max.iter.tries` (default `5*iterations`) attempts, an error will be raised. 
#'
#' Finally, missing death ages (stored in `CurAge` in the pedigree) of 
#' individuals who are affected for at least one cancer and/or reported at 
#' least one intervention are imputed, using the maximum of their cancer and 
#' intervention ages as the lower bound (see \code{\link{.currentAgeImpute}} 
#' documentation). If a lower imputation bound cannot be found using this 
#' approach and the individual has children in the pedigree, we assign their 
#' `CurAge` to be `15` plus the maximum difference in their living children's 
#' ages in the current imputation. (If the individual has one or zero living 
#' children, `CurAge` is simply set to `15`.) In cases where the individual 
#' has no children in the pedigree, their `CurAge` is set to `1`. 
#' 
#' @param ped A pedigree data frame returned by 
#' \code{\link{.pedStructureCheck}}. 
#' @param rel_l The list of relationships in `ped` returned by 
#' \code{\link{.pedStructureCheck}}. 
#' @param proband A numeric value or vector of the unique IDs in `ped` 
#' corresponding to the proband(s). 
#' @param impute_times The number of iterations to be imputed for missing ages. 
#' @param max_iter_tries A numeric value indicating the maximum number of 
#' iterations that should be attempted when multiply imputing missing ages. 
#' @param penet_db The cancer penetrances for carriers returned by 
#' \code{\link{buildDatabase}} in the `penet$penet_c` list component. 
#' @param dist_age A list containing empirical distributions of female and male 
#' ages at first birth; female and male birth ages; and sibling age 
#' differences. The default is \code{\link{AgeDistribution}}. 
#' @param penet_cbc_db A numeric array of contralateral cancer penetrance for 
#' carriers returned by \code{\link{buildDatabase}} in the `penet$penet_cbc` 
#' list component. 
#' @return A list where each component is a matrix of imputed ages 
#' corresponding to `CurAge` (if one or more individuals in `ped` is missing 
#' their current age) or `AgeX`, where `X` is a cancer for which one or more 
#' individuals in `ped` is missing the affection age. Each matrix has 
#' `impute_times` rows; the column names are the IDs of the individuals for 
#' whom ages were imputed.
