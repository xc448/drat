7.2 The Licensee may not assign this agreement. Any purported assignment of this Agreement or the rights hereunder is null and void.

7.3 This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the parties and supersedes all negotiations, understandings or previous agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement may not be changed, modified, or extended except by written amendment executed by an authorized representative of each party.

7.4 This Agreement will be construed and governed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without giving effect to conflict of law provisions applicable therein.
